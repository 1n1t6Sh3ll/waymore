## About - v1.0

The idea behind **waymore** is to find even more links from the Wayback Machine than other existing tools.

ðŸ‘‰ The biggest difference between **waymore** and other tools is that it can also **download the archived responses** for URLs on wayback machine so that you can then search these for even more links, developer comments, extra parameters, etc. etc.

Anyone who does bug bounty will have likely used the amazing [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls) by @TomNomNoms. This tool gets URLs from [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) and additional links (if any) from one of the index collections on [index.commoncrawl.org](http://index.commoncrawl.org/).
You would have also likely used the amazing [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau) by @hacker\_ which also finds URL's from wayback archive, Common Crawl, but also from Alien Vault and URLScan.
Now **waymore** gets URL's from ALL of those sources too (with ability to filter more to get what you want):

- Wayback Machine (web.archive.org)
- Common Crawl (index.commoncrawl.org)
- Alien Vault OTX (otx.alienvault.com)
- URLScan (urlscan.io)

ðŸ‘‰ It's a point that many seem to miss, so I'll just add it again :) ... The biggest difference between **waymore** and other tools is that it can also **download the archived responses** for URLs on wayback machine so that you can then search these for even more links, developer comments, extra parameters, etc. etc.

## Input and Mode

The input `-i` can either be a domain only, e.g. `redbull.com` or a specific domain and path, e.g. `redbull.com/robots.txt`.

There are different modes that can be run for waymore. The `-mode` argument can be 3 different value:

- `U` - URLs will be retrieved from archive.org, commoncrawl.org (if `-xcc` is not passed) and otx.alienvault.com (if `-xvv` is not passed)
- `R` - Responses will be downloaded from archive.org
- `B` - Both URLs and Responses will be retrieved

If the input was a specific URL, e.g. `redbull.com/robots.txt` then the `-mode` defaults to `R`. Only responses will be downloaded. You cannot change the mode to `U` or `B` for a domain with path because it isn't necessary to retrieve URLs for a specific URL.

If the input is just a domain, e.g. `redbull.com` then the `-mode` defaults to `B`. It can be changed to `U` or `R` if required. When a domain only is passed then all URLs/responses are retrieved for that domain (and sub domains unless `-n` is passed). If the no sub domain option `-n` is passed then the `www` sub domain is still included by default.

## config.yml

The `config.yml` file have filter values that can be updated to suit your needs. These are all provided as comma separated lists:

- `FILTER_CODE` - Exclusions used to exclude responses we will try to get from web.archive.org, and also for file names when `-i` is a directory, e.g. `301,302`
- `FILTER_MIME` - MIME Content-Type exclusions used to filter links and responses from web.archive.org through their API, e.g. `'text/css,image/jpeg`
- `FILTER_URL` - Response code exclusions we will use to filter links and responses from web.archive.org through their API, e.g. `.css,.jpg`

**NOTE: The MIME types cannot be filtered for Alien Vault results because they do not return that in the API response.**

## Output

In the path of the `waymore.py` file, a `results` directory will be created. Within that, a directory will be created with target domain (or domain with path) passed with `-i`.
When run, the following files are created in the target directory:

- `waymore.txt` - If `-mode` is `U` or `B`, this file will contain links from archive.org. Also any additional links from commoncrawl.org (if `-xcc` wasn't passed) and otx.alienvault.com (if `-xav` wasn't passed).
- `index.txt` - If `-mode` is `R` or `B`, and `-url-filname` was not passed then archived responses will be downloaded and hash values will be used for the saved file names. This file contains a comma separated list of `<hash>,<archive URL>,<timestamp>` in case you need to know which URLs produced which response.
- `*.xnl` - These archived response files will be created if `-mode` was `R` or `B`. If `-url-filename` was passed the the file names will be the archive URL that generated the response, e.g. `https--example.com-robots.txt.xnl`, otherwise the file name will be a hash value, e.g. `7960113391501.xnl`. Using hash values mean that less files will be written as there will only be one file per unique response. These archived responses are edited, before being saved, to remove any reference to `web.archive.org`.

## Info and Suggestions

The number of links found, and then potentially the number of files archived responses you will download could potentially be **HUGE** for many domains. This tool isn't about speed, it's about finding more, so be patient.

There is a `-p` option to increase the number of processes (used when retrieving links from all sources, and downloading archived responses from archive.org). However, although it may not be as fast as you'd like, I would suggest leaving `-p` at the default of 3 because I personally found issues with getting responses with higher values. We don't want to cause these services any problems, so be sensible!

I often use the `-f` option because I want `waymore.txt` to contain ALL possible links. Even though I don't care about images, fonts, etc. it could still be useful to see all possible paths and maybe parameters. Any filters will always be applied to downloading archived responses though. You don't want to waste time downloading thousands of images!

Using the `-v` option can help see what is happening behind the scenes and could help you if you aren't getting the output you are expecting.

All the MIME Content Types of URL's found (by all sources except Alien Vault) will be displayed when `-v` is used. This may help to add further exclusions if you find you still get back things you don't want to see. If you spot a MIME type that is being included but you don't want that going forward, add it to the FILTER_MIME in `config.yml`.
It should be noted that sometimes the MIME type on archive.org is stored as `unk` and `unknown` instead of the real MIME so the filter won't necessarily remove it from their results. The `FILTER_URL` config settings can be used to remove these afterwards. For example, if a GIF has MIME type `unk` instead of `image/gif` (and that's in `FILTER_MIME`) then it won't get filtered, but if the url is `https://target.com/assets/logo.gif` and `.gif` is in `FILTER_URL` it won't get requested.

If `config.yml` doesn't exist, or the entries for filters, aren't in the file, then default filters are used. It's better to have the file and review these to ensure you are getting what you need.

There can potentially be millions of responses so make sure you set filters, but also the Limit (`-l`), From Date (`-from`), To Date (`-to`) and/or Capture Interval (`-ci`) if you need to. The limit defaults to 5000, but say you wanted to get the latest 20,000 responses from 2015 up until January 2018... you would pass `-l -20000 -from 2015 -to 201801`. The Capture Interval determines how many responses will get downloaded for a particular URL within a specified period, e.g. if you set to `m` you will only get one response per month for a URL. The default `d` will likely greatly reduce the number of responses and unlikely to miss many unique responses unless a target changed something more than once in a given day.

**The provider API servers aren't designed to cope with huge volumes, so be sensible and considerate about what you hit them with!**

## Some Basic Examples

### Example 1

Just get the URLs from all sources for `redbull.com` (`-mode U` is just for URLs, so no responses are downloaded):

<center><img src="https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore/blob/main/example1.png"></center>

The URLs are saved in the same path as `waymore.py` under `results/redbull.com/waymore.txt`

### Example 2

Get ALL the URLs from Wayback for `redbull.com` (no filters are applied with `-f`, and no URLs are retrieved from Commone Crawl because `-xcc` is passed, or from Alien Vault because `-xav` is passed).
Save the FIRST 1000 responses that are found starting from 2015 (`-l 1000 -from 2015`):

<center><img src="https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore/blob/main/example2.png"></center>

The `-mode` wasn't explicitly set so defaults to `B` (Both - retrieve URLs AND download responses).
A file will be created for each unique response and also saved in `results/redbull.com/`:

<center><img src="https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore/blob/main/example3.png"></center>

There will also be a file `results/redbull.com/index.txt` that will contain a reference to what URLs gave the response for what file, e.g.

```
4847147712618,https://web.archive.org/web/20220426044405/https://www.redbull.com/additional-services/geo ,2022-06-24 20:07:50.603486
```

where `4847147712618` is the hash value of the response in `4847147712618.xnl`, the 2nd value is the Wayback Machine URL where you can view the actual page that was archived, and the 3rd is a time stamp of when the response was downloaded.

## Finding Way More URLs!

So now you have lots of archived responses and you want to find extra links? Easy! Why not use [xnLinkFinder](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/xnLinkFinder)?
For example:

```
python3 xnLinkFinder -i ~/Tools/waymore/results/redbull.com -sp https://www.redbull.com -sf redbull.com -o redbull.txt
```

Or run other tools such as [trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) or [gf](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) over the directory of responses to find even more from the archived responses!

## Issues

If you come across any problems at all, or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to raise an issue on Github. If there is a problem, it will be useful if you can provide the exact command you ran and a detailed description of the problem. If possible, run with `-v` to reproduce the problem and let me know about any error messages that are given.

## TODO

- Allow a file of domains (or domains with paths) to be passed with `-i` argument
- Add an `-oss` argument that accepts a file of Out Of Scope subdomains/URLs that will not be returned in the output, or have any responses downloaded
- Add an `-o` output option to specify a directory in which you want the search domain's directory created (to store responses), or just for a specific file if set `-mode U` to get just a file of URL's
